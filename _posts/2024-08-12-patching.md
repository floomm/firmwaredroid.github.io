### Patching FMD Instance
Generally, every release can have breaking changes. Thus, better to check the release notes before updating the
FMD instance. When patching an FMD instance, you need to ensure that existing docker containers and images are
removed before applying the patch. This is because otherwise, you may encounter issues with leftover
containers and images.

To remove all existing containers and images, you can use the following commands to clean the docker environment:
```bash
cd FirmwareDroid
# Stop all running containers
docker compose stop
# Remove all containers from the system
docker container prune
# Remove all images from the system forcefully
docker rmi -f $(docker images -a -q)
# Remove build cache
docker builder prune
```
Please note that cleaning the docker builder is necessary as otherwise, the build cache may cause issues when
building the new images. Cleaning the docker environment will not affect the data stored in the database or your
environment files.

After cleaning the docker environment, you can proceed with applying the patch to the FMD instance.
```bash
# Pull the latest changes from the repository
git pull
# Apply the patch
./docker/build_docker_images.sh
# Start the FMD instance
docker compose up -d
```

After applying the patch, you can verify that the FMD instance is running correctly by checking the logs.
```bash
docker compose logs -f
```
If there are any issues, you can refer to the logs to identify the problem and take appropriate action. Generally, we
do not apply database migration scripts for patch releases. However, if there are any changes to the database schema,
you may need to apply the migration scripts manually. In such a case, the release notes will provide instructions on
how to apply the migration scripts or you can reach out to the development team for assistance. Alternatively, you can
start with an empty database by removing the existing database and letting the FMD instance create a new one.
